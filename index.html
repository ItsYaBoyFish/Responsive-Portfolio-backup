        My name is Austin Graves. I am currently in the learning process for full stack web development. This website will lay out some of the qualities I believe you may be wandering in regards to my working career as well as work ethic. I currently am an Operations Manager for a computer software company focused on FDA regulation and compliance.

        As a Web Developer, I will focus solely on your needs. We will have a full schedule at which there will be "due dates" if you will. Each one of these is important to the success of our project as a group.
